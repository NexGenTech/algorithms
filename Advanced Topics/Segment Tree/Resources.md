### Resources for Segment tree

We suggest to read from more than one source, in order to build a good intuition on the topic:

* Hackerearth: [Introduction to Segment Tree](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/segment-trees/tutorial/)
* TopCoder: [Range Minimum Query and Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/range-minimum-query-and-lowest-common-ancestor/)
* Blog: [A simple approach to segment trees](https://kartikkukreja.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/a-simple-approach-to-segment-trees/)
* VisualAlgo: [Visualization of Min Segment Tree](https://visualgo.net/en/segmenttree)
* Hackerearth: [Introduction to lazy propagation in Segment Tree](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/segment-tree-and-lazy-propagation/)

Here is a [first question](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/segment-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/range-minimum-query/) to practice.
